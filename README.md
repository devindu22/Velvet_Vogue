# Velvet Vogue

### Project Title: Development of the Velvet Vogue E-Commerce Ecosystem
This project involves the design and implementation of a comprehensive multi-page web solution for "Velvet Vogue," a fashion startup owned by John Finlo. The primary objective was to transform a physical business vision into a high-performing digital brand.

By leveraging PHP and MySQL, we have developed a secure, responsive platform that caters to the needs of young adults. Key deliverables included a visually compelling product showcase, an intuitive category-based filtering system (Gender, Size, Price), and a robust user authentication framework. The system facilitates a complete "Purchase-to-Profile" journey, allowing customers to manage their own accounts while providing the administrator with a bespoke dashboard to handle inventory and business growth.
